# Arnold_to_Legacy_Shaders
Turns Arnold shaders to legcay shaders

There's a confirmation window before the process is done.
The process is undoable.
The shaders should keep the conncetion to the file node they originally had.
They also keep the same name.

Just paste the code into the PYTHON tab of the script editor. Make a shelf button or run from the script editor directly.
You must select the mesh objects you want to switch.

This is a quick tool I made but I'm open to doing more with it.
